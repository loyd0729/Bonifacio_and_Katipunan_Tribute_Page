			<p>Andres Bonifacio was born on November 30, 1863 in a small hut at Calle Azcarraga,
				presently known as Claro M. Recto Avenue in Tondo, Manila.  His parents were
				Santiago Bonifacio and Catalina de Castro.Andres was the eldest in a brood of five.
				His other siblings were Ciriaco, Procopio, Troadio, Esperidiona and Maxima.
				He obtained his basic education through a certain Guillermo Osmeña of Cebu.
				The Bonifacio family was orphaned when Andres was barely fourteen. With this,
				Andres assumed the responsibility of raising his younger siblings.</p>

			<h2>SITUATION DURING ANDRES TIME</h2>
		</div>
				<p>Andres Bonifacio was born in an era when the natives were considered Indios and
				the Spanish friars were believed to be God’s representative on earth.  He observed
				that the Filipinos during his time were not free and the Spanish government and
				the Catholic Church enslaved them.  During the same period,
				Freemasonry and its doctrine gained popularity.
			  Bonifacio admired Jose Rizal for his great effort in awakening Filipino nationalism.
				He even witnessed and joined the founding of La Liga Filipina spearheaded by Rizal
				on 3 July 1892.  Sadly, the organization died naturally after Rizal was exiled in Dapitan.
				Prior to his involvement in free masonry and Liga, Bonifacio continued to work in Fressel & Co.
				and sell fans and canes. He met Ladislao Diwa, and Teodoro Plata who would play major roles
				in the establishment of the Katipunan.</p>

			<h2>THE KATIPUNAN</h2>
		</div>
				<p>On July 7, 1892, the Kataastaasan, Kagalanggalangang Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan was
					founded in the house of Deodato Arellano at 734 Calle El Cano cor. Azcarraga.  Membership
					was through blood compact symbolizing the foundation of the secret society, which aimed
					the separation of the Philippines from Spain and the expulsion of the Spaniards in the country.
					The first Supremo of the Katipunan was Deodato Arellano, followed by Roman Basa and finally,
					Andres Bonifacio.</p>

			<div class="tulo">
				<h2>THE PLAN FOR A REVOLUTION</h2>
			</div>
					<p>An important meeting held on 3 May 1896 concluded with a plan to rescue Rizal from Dapitan
						to lead the revolution.  The task was assigned to Dr. Pio Valenzuela.  Unfortunately, Rizal
						expressed his opposition to the idea of launching an unprepared revolution against a strong
						nation protected by well-armed defense force. In the end, he urged that if the revolution is
						inevitable, the revolutionary members should seek the help of the rich and influential people
						to convince them to support the cause of the revolution.  He also suggested that the service
						of Antonio Luna be secured by the organization because of his military expertise and affiliation w
						ith rich and influential Filipinos.</p>

			<div class="upat">
				<h2>THE DISCOVERY OF THE KATIPUNAN</h2>
			</div>
					<p>The quarrel between two employees of the printing shop publishing Diario de Manila resulted in
						the discovery of Katipunan.  This happened after Apolonio dela Cruz was given a P2 raise in salary
						and Teodoro Patiño was not given any.  A heated argument sparked between them which led Patiño to
						confide the secrets of the Katipunan to his sister Honoria at the convent where she was staying,
						her tearful reaction attracted the attention of one of the nuns. The nun in turn, persuaded Patiño
						to tell everything he knew to Fr. Mariano Gil, the parish priest of Tondo.  After hearing the revelations,
						Fr. Gil contacted the authorities and urged them to raid the printing shop.  Documents, oaths signed in
						blood, receipts and ledgers related to Katipunan were confiscated from the shop.</p>

			<div class="lima">
				<h2>ILL FATED DESTINY</h2>
			</div>
					<p>As a result of the fateful experiences he encountered in Cavite, Bonifacio planned to return to Montalban
						and San Mateo.  On their way to Montalban, he and his followers passed by Limbon, Indang – a place in Cavite
						where food was scarce and people were tightfisted. At this point, Severino de las Alas turned his back against
						Bonifacio. The angered Bonifacio responded with threats and words that were wrongly interpreted by the people
						of Indang.  The people sought the help of Aguinaldo, who immediately ordered the arrest of Bonifacio.</p>
					<p>On 27 April 1897, skirmishes took place between the forces of Bonifacio and Aguinaldo.  In the said scuffle,
						Ciriaco was killed, while Procopio and the Supremo were caught. Andres Bonifacio was stabbed in the neck, weakening
						him and soaking him in blood.</p>
					<p> On 10 May 1897, Procopio and Andres were shot at Mount Nagpatong, near Mount Buntis in Maragondon, Cavite. This
						event ended the short life of the Supremo.  His educational attainment and military expertise may not have been equal
						to that of other heroes but his love for the country was absolute.  His name will always be revered and serve as the
						battle cry of Filipinos who yearn for freedom oppression and injustice.</p>
