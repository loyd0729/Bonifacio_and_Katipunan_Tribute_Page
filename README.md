# Bonifacio_and_Katipunan_Tribute_Page
This is my first project in freeCodeCamp.org. The project is entitled "Andres Bonifacio and The Katipunan".
It's a tribute page for Andres Bonifacio and The Katipunan. Andres Bonifacio was a Filipino revolutionary 
leader and often called "The Father of Philippine Revolutionary".The Katipunan was a Filipino revolution 
society who fought against Spanish occupation during 1890s.
The Tribute Page project is a one page site. HTML was used as its foundation. CSS was used to design the page.
and make it more easy in the eyes. Boostrap was also used in the tribute page to make the page more responsive.
The Tribute Page could also be open in cell phones and tablets and it will perfectly align in users' 
cell phones or tablets. This is because of the use of Bootstrap.
